-Use pen and paper to visualize the problems
-Break down the problem into smaller chunks
-Dont spend too much time on a single problem
-The first 100 problems will be difficult after that the rest 
will before easier with more practise
-Simulate as if you are giving an interview for 
every problem.
-When you get stuck.Note down why you got stuck and study the topics 
necessary so that you dont get stuck on similar problems in the future
-Watch others solve the same problem to familiarize with different tecniques
NOTES
-The key to avoiding nested for loops is using dictionaries
-The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, 
Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.
